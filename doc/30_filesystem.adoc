= filesystem interaction

== intro

While `chili` is great at managing abstract things like "feeds" and "plugins," sometimes you just want to look at your files. You want to know what data you have, where it is, and how to organize it.

We are building a suite of commands called `chefs` (Chris Experimental File System) to give you a familiar, shell-like way to browse your ChRIS storage.

== the chefs ls command

If you have ever used a Linux or Mac terminal, you know the `ls` command. It lists files. We have brought this same convenience to `chili`.

```bash
chili chefs ls
```

This command looks at your current ChRIS folder context (remember _context_?) and lists everything in it.

=== what you will see

The output is designed to be clean and readable, using colors to help you distinguish item types:

|===
| Type | Color | Example

| **Directory**
| **Bold Blue**
| `data/`

| **Link**
| **Cyan**
| `link -> target`

| **File**
| Standard
| `image.dcm`
|===

It organizes the names into neat columns, so even if you have hundreds of files, you can scan them easily.

=== looking elsewhere

You aren't limited to just looking at your current directory. You can peek into any path you have access to:

```bash
chili chefs ls /home/jane.doe/uploads
```

This will list the contents of that specific folder without changing your current location.

== moving around

You can also change your current working directory using the `cd` command, just like in a real shell:

```bash
chili chefs cd /home/jane.doe/analysis
```

And if you ever get lost, you can ask "where am I?" with:

```bash
chili chefs pwd
```

== making things

Just like a real filesystem, you can create new directories and files.

=== creating folders

Need a new place to store your data? Use `mkdir`:

```bash
chili chefs mkdir new_project
```

This creates a folder named `new_project` in your current directory. You can also create folders deeper in the hierarchy:

```bash
chili chefs mkdir /home/jane.doe/analysis/run_01
```

=== touching files

Sometimes you just need an empty file, maybe as a placeholder or a signal. Use `touch`:

```bash
chili chefs touch empty_file.txt
```

This creates a zero-byte file at the specified path. If you need to create a file with content, check out the specialized file operations.

These tools are designed to make the remote ChRIS filesystem feel as comfortable and accessible as the one on your own laptop.

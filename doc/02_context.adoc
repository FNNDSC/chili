= intro

An important idea in `chili` is the concept of _context_. The _context_ of a command can be thought of as the scope of its activity -- or alternatively the possible set of implicit data which the command can access as it performs its actions.

== context is what?

Think of context like this: when you log into a ChRIS or CUBE instance, all subsequent commands are obviously being applied to, or executed on, this ChRIS.

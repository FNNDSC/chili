= advanced file operations

== intro

While `chefs` gives you the basics (`ls`, `touch`), sometimes you need to do more with files. You might want to create a file with specific text, upload a local file to ChRIS, or peek at what's inside a file stored on the server.

For these tasks, `chili` provides the `file` command suite.

== creating files with content

The `chefs touch` command is great for empty files, but what if you want to write a note or a script directly?

```bash
chili file create notes.txt --content "meeting at 2pm"
```

This creates `notes.txt` in your current folder and fills it with your text.

=== specifying paths

You aren't stuck in your current directory. You can tell `chili` exactly where to put the file:

```bash
chili file create --name README.md --path /home/jane.doe/project --content "# Project X"
```

Or, just include the path in the filename:

```bash
chili file create /home/jane.doe/project/README.md --content "# Project X"
```

== uploading from local

This is where it gets powerful. You can "create" a file in ChRIS by reading from a file on your own computer.

```bash
chili file create data.csv --from-file ./local_data.csv
```

This takes `./local_data.csv` from your laptop and creates `data.csv` on the ChRIS server. It's a quick and easy way to get single files into the system.

== viewing files

Want to see what's in a file without downloading it?

```bash
chili file view results.json
```

This prints the content of the file directly to your terminal. It's perfect for checking configuration files, logs, or small datasets.

= Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to build and install `chili` from source.

== Developer Setup

`chili` relies on a backend library called `cumin`, which must be built first.

=== 1. Clone the Repository

Assuming you have cloned the main repository containing both projects:

[source,bash]
----
git clone <repo_url>
cd <repo_name>
----

=== 2. Build `cumin`

First, navigate to the `cumin` directory, install dependencies, and build the project.

[source,bash]
----
cd cumin
npm install
npm run build
----

=== 3. Build and Link `chili`

Next, navigate to the `chili` directory. Note the use of `--ignore-scripts` to bypass optional dependency issues.

[source,bash]
----
cd ../chili
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run build
npm link
----

The `npm link` command is crucial as it makes the `chili` executable available globally in your terminal. You may need to run this with `sudo` depending on your system configuration.

== Verification

To verify the installation, try running the help command:

[source,bash]
----
chili --help
----

You should see the ChILI logo and a list of available commands.

= Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to build and install `chili` from source.

== Prerequisites: The Kitchen Sink

To cook `chili` without needing `sudo` or running into permission errors (EACCES), we strictly recommend using **NVM (Node Version Manager)**.

### Why NVM?
The build process (`make meal`) uses `npm link` to symlink the packages globally. On a standard Linux system, the global npm directory is `/usr/lib/node_modules`, which requires root access. `nvm` installs Node.js in your home directory (e.g., `~/.nvm`), allowing you to install and link global packages without `sudo`.

=== 1. Install NVM

If you don't have it yet, install NVM:

[source,bash]
----
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
----

Restart your terminal, then install and use the latest Node LTS:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
----

== Developer Setup

Once NVM is set up, you can use the "Cooking" makefile to handle everything.

=== 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the `chili` repository (and its siblings `cumin` and `salsa` if they are separate, though the Makefile handles cloning them if missing).

[source,bash]
----
git clone <repo_url>
cd chili
----

=== 2. The Full Meal

Run the all-in-one command to clone dependencies, install packages, build, test, and link everything globally.

[source,bash]
----
make meal
----

If your NVM environment is correct, this will complete successfully, and you will have the `chili` command available in your terminal immediately.

== Verification

To verify the installation, try running the help command:

[source,bash]
----
chili --help
----

You should see the ChILI logo and a list of available commands.

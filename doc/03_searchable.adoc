= searchable

== intro

In `chili`, you often need to tell a command _what_ to operate on. "Run _this_ plugin." "Delete _that_ feed." "List files in _this_ directory."

Usually, computer programs want cryptic ID numbers for this. "Run plugin #42." But humans are bad at remembering numbers. We prefer names. `chili` understands this and provides a powerful feature we call _searchables_.

A _searchable_ is just a text string you give to a command. `chili` looks at that string and figures out what you mean.

== simple search

Most of the time, you just want to find something by its name. Let's say you want to run the `pl-dircopy` plugin. You don't need to look up its ID number. You just tell `chili`:

```bash
chili plugin run pl-dircopy
```

`chili` sees "pl-dircopy", realizes it's a name, finds the plugin for you, and runs it. Simple.

== explicit search

Sometimes, "just the name" isn't enough. Maybe there are five different versions of `pl-dircopy` and you need a specific one. Or maybe you are looking for a feed created by a specific person.

In these cases, you can use a special key-value syntax. It looks like `key: value`.

For example, to find a plugin with a specific version:

```bash
chili plugin run "name: pl-dircopy, version: 2.1.1"
```

Notice how we separated the two facts we know (the name and the version) with a comma. `chili` will find the single plugin that matches _both_ of these rules.

You can use any filter that the ChRIS API supports. If you want to find a feed created by user `bob`:

```bash
chili feed delete "owner_username: bob"
```

== using searchables in context

This gets really powerful when combined with context. Imagine you want to start a session working on a specific plugin, but you don't know its ID. You can set your context using a searchable!

```bash
chili context set --ChRISplugin "name: pl-dircopy"
```

Now `chili` finds the plugin, gets its ID, and locks your session to it. Any subsequent commands that ask "which plugin?" will automatically use `pl-dircopy`.

This flexibility means you almost never have to memorize an ID number again. Just describe what you want, and let `chili` find it.

== examples cheat sheet

Here are some common ways to use searchables:

|===
| Goal | Searchable String

| **Find by Name**
| `"pl-dircopy"`

| **Find by ID**
| `"id: 14"`

| **Exact Name Match**
| `"name_exact: pl-dircopy"`

| **Specific Version**
| `"name: pl-dircopy, version: 2.0"`

| **Recent Feeds**
| `"limit: 5"` (implicitly sorts by default)

| **Feed by Creator**
| `"owner_username: bob"`

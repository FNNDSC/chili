# ChILI

_ChRIS Interactive Line Interface_

## Abstract

`chili` is a nodejs CLI and REPL for ChRIS. It also aspires to be _hot_!

## WARNING

Not ready for prime time -- and this doc is very old. Consult the `doc` subdir in this repo for more up to date documentation. At time of writing, this is probably `doc/13_run_a_plugin.adoc`.

## Installation

Once the repo is cloned, do

```
npm install
```

followed by

```
npm run build && npm link
```

## Usage

Assuming all worked, you should have `chili` ready to spice things up.
